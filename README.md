# Overview

AirPrintProfileCreator is a simple bash script which aids you in creating mobileconfig profiles that enable iOS devices to print to a CUPS server.

# Usage

Download and run the script ("sh AirPrintProfileCreator.sh") and follow the prompts on screen. When the profile has been created, you can install it on your iOS device via Configurator, MDM, or just post it online or email it to yourself.

# Requirements

The script should work on any recent Mac or other *nix systems with CUPS installed. I have only tested on OS X v 10.9. Your CUPS server must have a static/reserved IP.
